Python project using TKinter to simulate the Coriolis force applied to a body in free fall. Depending on the body's latitude, longitude and height of fall, it will be deflected more or less to the east by the Coriolis force resulting from the Earth's rotation.
To use the application, download the .exe file and the “world-map” image, place them in the same directory and run the .exe file.
\vec{F}_C = -2m (\vec{\Omega} \times \vec{v})
